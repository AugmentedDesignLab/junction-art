# Architecture:

1. Tools to gather core statistics on individual intersections and collections
2. Tools to aggregate results
3. Tools to visual results
4. Categorize by feature?

## Core
All the core statistics 

## Metrics - different metrics we create based on core statistics

### Intersection Complexity
Complexity of a turn = change in heading / length of the path.
