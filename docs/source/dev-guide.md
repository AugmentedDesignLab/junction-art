# Extending JunctionArt

This guide is for developers who wants to add new features in JunctionArt or build their new types of road artifacts and generators.

## Preparing the development environment


- [x] Install from source {ref}`installation:Installing from source2`
- [x] Setup esmini  [build 1067](https://github.com/esmini/esmini/releases/tag/v2.0.15). Newer versions do not work well with JunctionArt.
